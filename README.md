These courses are highly recommended by **PMI** (Project Management Institute) as they provide foundational knowledge and practical skills required for the CAPM certification.

For those aiming to pass the **PMP** (Project Management Professional) exam, the Professional Diploma in Agile and Project Management is a great choice. This course covers Agile methodologies and project management principles that align well with the PMP exam requirements.
